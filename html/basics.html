             <p>Yoga is an ancient discipline that combines physical, mental, and spiritual techniques to promote holistic well-being. Through physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation, yoga aims to balance the body and mind, enhance physical flexibility and strength, and foster inner calm while reducing stress. Beyond being a physical practice, yoga also encompasses ethical values and philosophies that guide toward a more mindful and harmonious life.

            <h3>Session structure</h3>
            <div class = "concepto">
            <p>A typical yoga session begins with a grounding phase that includes mindful breathing to center the mind and focus on the breath. This is followed by Sun Salutations, a flowing sequence of movements synchronized with the breath to warm up the body. The main part of the session focuses on various yoga poses (asanas), ranging from standing poses for stability to seated and twisting poses for flexibility and strength. Each pose is performed with mindful attention to alignment and breath. After the asanas, the session transitions into a relaxation phase with Savasana, allowing practitioners to integrate the benefits of the practice and achieve deep relaxation. Meditation or guided visualization may accompany this phase to enhance mental clarity and inner peace. The session concludes with a moment of gratitude, encouraging practitioners to carry the calmness and balance achieved on the mat into their daily lives.

            <p>Sun Salutations" are a dynamic sequence of movements in yoga designed to warm up the body and prepare it for the practice of poses (asanas). The sequence includes movements such as forward bends, backward stretches, poses involving bending and extending, and downward-facing dog pose. Each movement is performed coordinated with the breath, promoting flexibility, strength, and concentration. Sun Salutations are a fundamental part of many yoga practices, helping to improve circulation, agility, and overall mood during the session.

            <h3>Breathing</h3>
            <div class = "concepto">
            <p>Breathing in yoga, known as pranayama, is essential to the practice and focuses on consciously controlling and directing the breath. It is used to calm the mind, increase body awareness, and enhance the connection between the body and mind. In yoga, breathing is done through the nose with deep and full abdominal movements, known as diaphragmatic breathing. Besides providing oxygen to the body, proper breathing during asana (posture) practice helps maintain stability and energy, facilitating smooth and efficient movement flow. Synchronizing breath with physical movement also helps reduce stress and promotes relaxation, creating a sense of calm and overall well-being.

            <p>
             Meditation in yoga is a practice that aims to calm the mind, promote mental clarity, and cultivate mindfulness. It is typically done at the end of a yoga session, after performing physical postures (asanas) and conscious breathing (pranayama). During meditation, practitioners sit in a comfortable posture, close their eyes, and direct their attention inward, observing thoughts and sensations without judgment. Techniques such as focusing on the breath, repeating mantras, or visualization may be used to help maintain a focused and calm mind. Yoga meditation not only helps reduce stress and improve emotional management, but also promotes a state of inner peace and spiritual connection, contributing to overall well-being.
